  <h3> LIVING GROUND </h3>
  <h2> Redefine Six-feet Distancing </h2>
  <p class="project-info"> Group Project </p>
  <p class="project-info"> 2020 </p>
  <p class="project-info"> World Landscape Architecture Student Ideas Competition, Runner up </p>
  <p class="project-info"> Team Members: Xi (Echo) Chen, Sufeng (Sophia) Xiao, Xuezhen (Esther) Xie, Siqi (Joyce) Zhu </p>
  <p class="project-info"> Role in Team: conceptual design (30%), visual representation (30%) </p>

  <p class="texts">Reimagining the Spaces in between is a idea competition that
aims to address the various issues raised by COVID-19 and
to develop ideas that provide safe, inclusive, and equitable
spaces for everyone in a fictional city. Living Ground
explored the potentials of the specific scale raised to public
attention by the pandemic: six feet distancing. Our team
investigates different scenarios that occupy 6ft * 6ft unit space
and beyond. The project employs a grid system to offer both
a sense of distance and a way to organize programs on the
site. Currently, activities are centralized and programmed in
urban public space, and the lack of collaboration between
different institutions leads to the rigid separation of various
programs. The project reflects the significance of landscape
architecture in making urban spaces and explores the future
of urban space with flexibility and resilience. </p>

  <p class="texts"> The project aims to promote three prototypes of cooperation between social groups. <strong> Prototype 1: Reciprocal cooperation of parking space.
</strong> By encouraging the office building to provide
underutilized underground parking for nearby
retail stores, outdoor parking lots are activated for
public use, such as urban markets. The activation
of the parking lot space returns the office buildings
with commercial profits, which formulate
reciprocal cooperation between institutions. <strong> Prototype 2: Urban agriculture engagement. </strong> Retail stores and communities
collaborate to create the collective
community garden, which provides
job opportunities for community and
publicity for local business. In the
case of a pandemic, the government
can encourage the communities to
expand the gardens for local food
supply.<strong> Prototype 3: Collaborative town square renovation </strong> City government negotiates with all types of
stakeholders, including residents, retailers, and
office managers in the process of town square
renovation, to showcase citizens as the key image
showcased in the town square. </p>

  <p class="texts">The plan promotes different levels of sociability
and great flexibility. The living pavement system
enables the flexible organization of space that
adapts to various circumstances. The bottom
layer of each paving unit stores the seeds. In areas
with less circulation or when social distancing
is needed, the top layer can be dismantled,
allowing plants to grow and become a buffer
between people. The plants also absorb rainwater
and provide stormwater management in case of
intense precipitation. The public open spaces are
decentralized and fragmented, providing spaces
for community congregation and small group
retreat.
The living pavement system allows the easy
transformation of the landscape. Different patterns
of pavement can be formed to achieve different
green space ratios and to design different paths for
circulation.
Based on the 6 feet x 6 feet grid system of the
pavement, various programs can be accommodated
into 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 units, and beyond. The
community is encouraged to assemble and
organize the programs based on their changing
needs. </p>

<p class="texts"> As the needs and intensity of different types of programs
change across time, the infrastructures designed for
corresponding programs change form. </p>
