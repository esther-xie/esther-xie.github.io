      <p class="texts">Reimagining the Spaces in between is a idea competition that
          aims to address the various issues raised by COVID-19 and
          to develop ideas that provide safe, inclusive, and equitable
          spaces for everyone in a fictional city. Living Ground
          explored the potentials of the specific scale raised to public
          attention by the pandemic: six feet distancing. Our team
          investigates different scenarios that occupy 6ft * 6ft unit space
          and beyond. The project employs a grid system to offer both
          a sense of distance and a way to organize programs on the
          site. Currently, activities are centralized and programmed in
          urban public space, and the lack of collaboration between
          different institutions leads to the rigid separation of various
          programs. The project reflects the significance of landscape
          architecture in making urban spaces and explores the future
          of urban space with flexibility and resilience. </p>

      <p class="texts"> The project aims to promote three prototypes of cooperation between social groups. <strong>
          Prototype 1: Reciprocal cooperation of parking space.
      </strong> By encouraging the office building to provide
          underutilized underground parking for nearby
          retail stores, outdoor parking lots are activated for
          public use, such as urban markets. The activation
          of the parking lot space returns the office buildings
          with commercial profits, which formulate
          reciprocal cooperation between institutions. <strong> Prototype 2: Urban agriculture engagement. </strong>
          Retail stores and communities
          collaborate to create the collective
          community garden, which provides
          job opportunities for community and
          publicity for local business. In the
          case of a pandemic, the government
          can encourage the communities to
          expand the gardens for local food
          supply.<strong> Prototype 3: Collaborative town square renovation </strong> City government negotiates with all
          types of
          stakeholders, including residents, retailers, and
          office managers in the process of town square
          renovation, to showcase citizens as the key image
          showcased in the town square. </p>

      <p class="texts">The plan promotes different levels of sociability
          and great flexibility. The living pavement system
          enables the flexible organization of space that
          adapts to various circumstances. The bottom
          layer of each paving unit stores the seeds. In areas
          with less circulation or when social distancing
          is needed, the top layer can be dismantled,
          allowing plants to grow and become a buffer
          between people. The plants also absorb rainwater
          and provide stormwater management in case of
          intense precipitation. The public open spaces are
          decentralized and fragmented, providing spaces
          for community congregation and small group
          retreat.
          The living pavement system allows the easy
          transformation of the landscape. Different patterns
          of pavement can be formed to achieve different
          green space ratios and to design different paths for
          circulation.
          Based on the 6 feet x 6 feet grid system of the
          pavement, various programs can be accommodated
          into 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 units, and beyond. The
          community is encouraged to assemble and
          organize the programs based on their changing
          needs. </p>

      <img class="projectimg" src="images/programs.jpg" alt="living pavement system">
      <p class="texts"> As the needs and intensity of different types of programs
          change across time, the infrastructures designed for
          corresponding programs change form. </p>
