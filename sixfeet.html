  <p class="project-info"> World Landscape Architecture Student Ideas Competition, Runner up </p>
  <p class="project-info"> Team members: Xi (Echo) Chen, Sufeng (Sophia) Xiao, Xuezhen (Esther) Xie, Siqi (Joyce) Zhu </p>
  <p class="project-info"> Role in team: conceptual design (30%), visual representation (30%) </p>

  <p class="texts">Reimagining the Spaces in between is a idea competition that
aims to address the various issues raised by COVID-19 and
to develop ideas that provide safe, inclusive, and equitable
spaces for everyone in a fictional city. Living Ground
explored the potentials of the specific scale raised to public
attention by the pandemic: six feet distancing. Our team
investigates different scenarios that occupy 6ft * 6ft unit space
and beyond. The project employs a grid system to offer both
a sense of distance and a way to organize programs on the
site. Currently, activities are centralized and programmed in
urban public space, and the lack of collaboration between
different institutions leads to the rigid separation of various
programs. The project reflects the significance of landscape
architecture in making urban spaces and explores the future
of urban space with flexibility and resilience. </p>
