  <p class="texts"> For the Rome Workshop, our team of five students analysed historical and existing conditions of the Roman neighborhood of Torrevecchia, and explored possible future trajectories of this dynamic area. With its vibrant mix of market activity, varied subsectors of food systems and immigrant communities each actively redefining Torrevecchiaâ€™s sense of place, this modest area has changed from a satellite residential district into a developing and self-sustaining neighborhood with an identity all its own. A comprehensive report with analysis of context, neighborhood statistics, and physical characteristics, in addition to three posters of summary were produced through collabration over the semester.</p>
